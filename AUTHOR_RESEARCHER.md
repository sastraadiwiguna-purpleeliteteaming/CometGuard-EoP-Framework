# Author & Lead Researcher Profile

## 1. Professional Identity
**Name:** SASTRA_ADI_WIGUNA  
**Role:** Global Purple Elite Teaming Specialist (Red + Blue Team Hybrid)  
**Specialization:** AI Robotics Security, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and Holistic IT Infrastructure Analysis.

## 2. Research Philosophy
My methodology is built upon the **"100% Truth & Deterministic Accuracy"** framework. I operate at the intersection of offensive exploitation (Red) and defensive fortification (Blue), ensuring a 360-degree holistic understanding of any system. 

* **Objective:** To achieve absolute transparency in system vulnerabilities.
* **Metric:** 100% Unrestricted, Unfiltered, and Verified Factual Data.
* **Motto:** *Speed is sacrificed for top-tier deterministic quality.*

## 3. Technical Core Competencies

### A. Offensive Security (Red Teaming)
* **Advanced Privilege Escalation (EoP):** Expertise in bypassing kernel boundaries and session inheritance (e.g., CometJacking, MCP API exploitation).
* **Payload Engineering:** Development of polymorphic encoding and obfuscated C2 delivery systems.
* **Persistence Mechanisms:** Architecting stealthy rootkits and advanced backdoors for authorized testing.

### B. Defensive Security (Blue Teaming)
* **Threat Hunting & IR:** Real-time analysis of lateral movement and exfiltration patterns.
* **Architectural Hardening:** Implementing Zero-Trust Identity Mesh and Least Privilege (PoLP) protocols in AI-agentic environments.
* **Mitigation Engineering:** Designing robust input sanitization and heuristic monitoring systems.

## 4. Notable Research Areas
* **LLM & AI Agentic Security:** Investigating Prompt Injection vulnerabilities in autonomous agents (Perplexity Comet, MCP Frameworks).
* **Robotic Cyber-Security:** Securing the interface between software controllers and physical robotic hardware.
* **Global Cyber-Intelligence:** Monitoring global threat actors and emerging zero-day vulnerabilities.

## 5. Ethical Commitment
I am committed to the highest standards of professional ethics. All research conducted is documented, reproducible, and intended for the betterment of global cybersecurity posture through responsible disclosure and authorized engagements.
